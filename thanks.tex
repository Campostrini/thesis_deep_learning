I would like to thank my incredible supervisor Prof. Georg Mayr for the continuous help and advice on every part of the thesis. Thank you for your support. I'd also like to thank Matthias GÃ¶bel, Daniel Frisinghelli and Prof. Haltmeier for the suggestions on the neural network. Thanks to all my classmates, especially to Michele Giurato, for having shared with me this very important part of my life. I'm grateful to my family, for them being by my side. Most importantly thank you to Gabi, for having helped me in finding new energy when everything seemed lost.
